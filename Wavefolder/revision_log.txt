rev 1
- redo pcb routing
- remove R22, the 510R resistor in feedback loop of final fold opamp.
  I kinda monkey-see-monkey-do'd that resistor into the schem. It's
  not on the original Serge schematic. Maybe it was put there for
  current limiting, but that isn't needed. I don't think it serves
  a real purpose so it's gone!
- added C14 for stability just to be safe
